the amount of calories, and all information about healthy foods.  And allows customers to communicate with nutritionists.

The second server displays the appropriate food menus according to the plan, as well as modification, deletion and addition to meals ,  
And the third sends alerts on the date of taking the necessary supplements . 

## Statement of Problem  
 It is difficult for customers to stick to the diet plan.

 Some customers cannot be patient to abstain from the foods they love for a period of time and keep the plan.

The system will allow customers to eat what they want, 
but to a certain amount and not to overdo it so as not to harm the nutritional plan.  
And each customer will specify what he wants to eat within the plan with a limited amount of food .
