## Introduction
The healthy diet will allow the improvement and development of clientsâ€™ health, 
by subscribing to this system and choosing the subscription period (weekly, monthly, yearly). 
Designing a nutritional plan for the client, whether it is to lose weight, increase it or keep it constant  Presentation of results and reports.  
What distinguishes this system is that it will enable the customer to see the benefits of meals, 
the amount of calories, and all information about healthy foods.  And allows customers to communicate with nutritionists.  
There will be three servants.  The first server takes the client's data (weight, age, length, plan type).  
The second server displays the appropriate food menus according to the plan, as well as modification, deletion and addition to meals ,  
And the third sends alerts on the date of taking the necessary supplements . 

## Statement of Problem  
 It is difficult for customers to stick to the diet plan.  
 Especially the foods they love the most.  
 Some customers cannot be patient to abstain from the foods they love for a period of time and keep the plan.


## Proposed Approach   
The system will allow customers to eat what they want, 
but to a certain amount and not to overdo it so as not to harm the nutritional plan.  
And each customer will specify what he wants to eat within the plan with a limited amount of food .
